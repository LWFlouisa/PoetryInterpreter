During the cold Spring rain,
The drops of blue on grass.
All that is profane
Shall all turn into glass.
Of all the ways to fall down,
The glass shall revert to grass.
In all many pieces
That have returned to
glass, the many pieces,
All that is profane,
Shall all turn into glass.
Of all the ways to fall down,
The glass shall revert to the grass.
