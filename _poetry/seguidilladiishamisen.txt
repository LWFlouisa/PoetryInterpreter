Between hills and forests,
Under blown leaf,
The wolf hunts a black sheep,
Under blown leaf,
Between hills and forests,
The shadows glare,
Beneath the damp leaf,
Mignon girl running,
To catch a deer blitzing,
The daffodil flops,
As the day comes closing,
As the day comes closing,
The moonlight is,
Hovering; cloudy sky,
Pouring with the,
Rain falling from the sky,
Only tears end this day,
The wolf now is so hungry,
For the dark brown dress,
The wolf now is so hungry,
For a long caress,
The wolf now is so hungry,
For the blood on dress,
From Daffodil's blood,
