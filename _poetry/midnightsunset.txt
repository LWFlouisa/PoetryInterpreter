I seek the cold water, down river
flowing.
For all those lights
In the city nights
glowing.
To clear thoughts
For all misery
growing.
For me I wither
In your so gentle arms
In your embrace.
I now seek that embrace.
I now seek that embrace.
So small I feel
And yet, embrace
The flow around my neck
And down my spine.
For you my divine.
For you my divine.
To think I am but a
Small thing, yet I trust it
That you love
Under midnight sunset.
Under midnight sunset.
