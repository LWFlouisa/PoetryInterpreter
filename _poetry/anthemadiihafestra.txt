All the old women
Carrying the hunger pains.
All the old men
Working the night shift.
Carrying the hunger pains,
We want liberty.
Carrying the hunger pains,
Working the night shift.
Along the bright city lights.
Along the bright city lights.
How proud we be
To be of the shining knights,
With pitchforks and sledge.
Arise, fatherland's children,
May your rein last 1000 years.
Arise, fatherland's children,
Become like boulders,
Grow into a battalion.
Arm our citizens.
The blades so sharp
And true to a point.
Uniforms so sleak.
The nighthawk reins highlands.
The nighthawk reins highlands.
From the sky it drops
To eat fallen depris.
From the sky it drops
All the dust from the dark sky.
All the dust from the dark sky.
Arise, fatherland's children,
May your rein last 1000 years.
Arise, fatherland's children,
Become like boulders,
Grow into a battalion.
Arm our citizens.
